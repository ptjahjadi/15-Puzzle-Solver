# 15-Puzzle-Solver
## Aim
This project aims to develop a code written in C to find the best solution to solve a state of a 15-Puzzle.
## Summary
The 15-Puzzle is a widely-recognised sliding puzzle that consists of numbered squares with one tile missing. Using an IDA* implementation and Manhattan Heuristic, a C code is developed to solve random states of a 15-Puzzle, read from a dataset. A report for the experimentation can be found in 'experimentation.pdf'.
## Guide
* 'lastmove.c' and 'puzzle.c' are C codes for this project.
* 'experimentation.pdf' contains the experimental report for this project.
* '1.puzzle' contains the raw dataset of the 15-puzzle, with various random states.
A makefile is also provided to compile the code for this project.
## Built With
